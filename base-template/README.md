A new project in the making.

## Getting Started

```
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

Now visit [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/)

### Running the Tests

There is a basic test framework in your `test/` folder. Here's how to use it:

```bash
$ npm test                 # runs all tests
$ npm test server/index.js # runs tests in a single file
```

## Made with Concatapult
